# Algorithm-Project
<b><i>Design and write a program to solve the following problems:</i>

A. (10 Points) Given a set of N jobs where each job i  has a deadline and profit
associated with it. Each job takes 1 unit of time to complete and only one job
can be scheduled at a time. We earn the profit associated with job if and only if
the job is completed by its deadline. Find the number of jobs done and
the maximum profit. Jobs will be given in the form (Job id , Deadline, Profit)
associated with that Job.

B. (10 Points) You are given a list of N jobs with their start time, end time, and
the profit you can earn by doing that job. Your task is to find the maximum
profit you can earn by picking up some (or all) jobs, ensuring no two jobs
overlap. If you choose a job that ends at time X, you will be able to start
another job that starts at time X.</b>
